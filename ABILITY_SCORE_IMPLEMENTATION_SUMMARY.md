# Ability Score System Implementation Summary

## âœ… Complete Implementation - D&D SRD 5.2 Compliant

The SoloHeart ability score system has been fully implemented according to your specifications. All requirements have been met and tested.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented

### 1. Core Ability Score Data Structure âœ…
- **Six standard D&D ability scores**: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
- **Integer storage**: All scores stored as integers (default: 10 if unassigned)
- **Modifier calculation**: Using standard formula `modifier = floor((score - 10) / 2)`
- **Persistent storage**: Scores persist in character data and survive session reloads

### 2. SRD 5.2-Compliant Assignment Methods âœ…

#### **Standard Array** âœ…
- Uses official SRD 5.2 array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
- Automatically assigns highest scores to class primary abilities
- Distributes remaining scores based on character personality
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/assign` with `{"method": "standard_array"}`

#### **Point Buy** âœ…
- Implements 27-point system using official SRD cost chart
- Validates point costs: 8(0), 9(1), 10(2), 11(3), 12(4), 13(5), 14(7), 15(9)
- Prevents exceeding 27-point cap
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/assign` with `{"method": "point_buy"}`

#### **AI-Optimized Assignment** âœ…
- Uses Standard Array but AI assigns based on:
  - Character class (primary abilities prioritized)
  - Background and personality traits
  - Roleplay style and intended play focus
  - Story elements and character description
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/assign` with `{"method": "auto"}`

#### **Roll 4d6 Drop Lowest** âœ…
- Implements official SRD 5.2 rolling method
- Rolls 4d6 for each ability, drops lowest die
- Assigns highest rolls to class primary abilities
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/assign` with `{"method": "roll"}`

#### **Manual Entry** âœ…
- Allows players to enter their own scores
- Validates against SRD 5.2 rules
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/assign` with `{"method": "manual", "scores": {...}}`

### 3. Validation System âœ…
- **Method-specific validation**: Each assignment method has its own validation rules
- **Range checking**: Scores must be between 1-20
- **Duplicate prevention**: Prevents duplicate ability targets during assignment
- **Point Buy validation**: Ensures 27-point cap is not exceeded
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/validate`

### 4. Character Sheet Rendering âœ…
- **Clear display**: Ability scores and modifiers rendered clearly
- **Formatted output**: STR: 14 (+2), INT: 10 (+0) format
- **HTML test page**: `/test-character-sheet` shows formatted character sheet
- **API integration**: Both API and UI display scores properly

### 5. Persistence âœ…
- **Session persistence**: Scores survive game session reloads
- **Save/load cycles**: Data persists through save/load operations
- **Character state**: Integrated with character creation workflow

### 6. API Endpoints âœ…

#### **GET /api/character/create/ability-scores/methods**
- Returns available assignment methods
- Includes class recommendations
- Shows current character class
- **Response**: Methods with descriptions and recommendations

#### **POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/assign**
- Assigns scores using specified method
- Returns formatted response with score summary
- Updates character data
- **Methods**: auto, standard_array, point_buy, roll, manual

#### **GET /api/character/create/ability-scores/current**
- Returns current ability scores and modifiers
- Includes formatted summary
- **Response**: Scores, modifiers, and summary

#### **POST /api/character/create/ability-scores/validate**
- Validates manually entered scores
- Returns validation result and modifiers
- **Input**: Scores and method
- **Response**: Validation status and formatted summary

### 7. Child-Friendly Presentation âœ…
- **Encouraging language**: "Perfect! I've assigned your ability scores..."
- **Story-based feedback**: References character story and personality
- **Clear explanations**: Each method explained in friendly terms
- **Positive reinforcement**: "Your character is ready! Would you like to start your adventure?"

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

All endpoints tested and working:

```bash
# Test methods endpoint
curl http://localhost:5001/api/character/create/ability-scores/methods

# Test auto assignment
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/character/create/ability-scores/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "auto"}'

# Test standard array
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/character/create/ability-scores/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "standard_array"}'

# Test validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/character/create/ability-scores/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "manual", "scores": {"strength": 15, "dexterity": 14, "constitution": 13, "intelligence": 12, "wisdom": 10, "charisma": 8}}'

# Test current scores
curl http://localhost:5001/api/character/create/ability-scores/current

# Test character sheet display
curl http://localhost:5001/test-character-sheet
```

## ðŸŽ² Class-Specific Optimizations

The system automatically optimizes scores based on character class:

- **Fighter/Paladin**: Prioritizes STR > CON
- **Rogue/Monk**: Prioritizes DEX > WIS/INT
- **Wizard**: Prioritizes INT > CON
- **Cleric/Druid**: Prioritizes WIS > CHA/CON
- **Bard/Sorcerer/Warlock**: Prioritizes CHA > CON/DEX

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

### Auto Assignment Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Perfect! I've assigned your ability scores based on your character's story:\n\n**Ability Scores:**\nâ€¢ **Strength**: 15 (+2) - Good\nâ€¢ **Dexterity**: 13 (+1) - Above Average\nâ€¢ **Constitution**: 14 (+2) - Good\nâ€¢ **Intelligence**: 12 (+1) - Above Average\nâ€¢ **Wisdom**: 10 (+0) - Average\nâ€¢ **Charisma**: 8 (-1) - Average\n\n\nYour character is ready! Would you like to start your adventure?",
  "character_data": {
    "ability_scores": {"strength": 15, "dexterity": 13, "constitution": 14, "intelligence": 12, "wisdom": 10, "charisma": 8},
    "ability_modifiers": {"strength": 2, "dexterity": 1, "constitution": 2, "intelligence": 1, "wisdom": 0, "charisma": -1}
  }
}
```
