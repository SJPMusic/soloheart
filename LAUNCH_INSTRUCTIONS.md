## What the Launcher Does

The SoloHeart launcher automatically handles:

âœ… **Python Version Check** - Ensures Python 3.8+ is installed  
âœ… **Virtual Environment** - Creates and activates the virtual environment  
âœ… **Dependencies** - Installs all required packages  
âœ… **Port Check** - Ensures port 5002 is available  
âœ… **Server Startup** - Starts the SoloHeart server  
âœ… **Browser Launch** - Opens the character creation page  
âœ… **Status Display** - Shows server URLs and next steps  

## Expected Experience

1. **Launch**: Run `./launch.sh` or `python3 launch_soloheart.py`
2. **Setup**: Watch the launcher handle all setup automatically
3. **Browser**: Your browser opens to the character creation page
4. **Create**: Describe your character in natural language
5. **Play**: Start your D&D adventure!

## Example Character Creation

Try this in the character creation interface:

> "My name is Elira. I'm an elven druid who survived a forest fire and now protects nature. I'm brave and mysterious, having learned ancient druidic secrets."

The AI will guide you through the rest of the character creation process.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 5002 is in use":
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :5002

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill -9 PID
```

### Virtual Environment Issues
If the virtual environment is corrupted:
```bash
# Remove and recreate
rm -rf venv
python3 launch_soloheart.py
```

### Dependencies Issues
If packages fail to install:
```bash
# Update pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Try again
python3 launch_soloheart.py
```
