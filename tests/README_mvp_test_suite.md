# 🧪 MVP Integration Test Suite

## Overview

The `test_narrative_loop_mvp.py` test suite validates all core integration pathways between **SoloHeart** and **The Narrative Engine (TNE)** required for the MVP launch. It simulates a minimal but complete gameplay cycle, evaluates responses, verifies alignment across systems, and confirms error handling and memory injection behaviors.

## 🎯 Purpose

This test suite executes and verifies all remaining items in `mvp_integration_checklist.md` to ensure the SoloHeart → TNE integration is production-ready for MVP launch.

## ✅ Tests Implemented

### 1. **TNEBridge Integration Smoke Test**
- **Goal**: Confirm `send_event_to_tne()` and `fetch_goal_alignment()` work with mock and live endpoints
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Coverage**: 
  - Mock mode testing with simulated responses
  - Live connectivity testing (when TNE is running)
  - Response structure validation

### 2. **Full Memory Injection Loop (Combat → Goal Feedback)**
- **Goal**: Validate combat action is transformed, injected, and receives correct symbolic feedback
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Coverage**:
  - Player action simulation: "Player attacks enemy with weapon"
  - Event formatting and mapping
  - Memory injection and acknowledgment
  - Goal alignment retrieval and validation
  - Relevant goal score verification (Protection, Heroism)

### 3. **Exploration and Dialogue Injection Flow**
- **Goal**: Validate memory loop for exploration and dialogue events
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Coverage**:
  - Exploration action: "Player discovers hidden location"
  - Dialogue action: "Player persuades the advisor to help"
  - Goal alignment shifts verification
  - Expected goal detection (Discovery, Wisdom, etc.)

### 4. **Session Journal Export Verification**
- **Goal**: Verify journal entries are recorded and retrievable
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Coverage**:
  - Journal export functionality
  - Chronological ordering validation
  - Entry structure verification
  - Required tag validation (type, timestamp, goal_context, emotion)

### 5. **Resilience to Invalid Event Payload**
- **Goal**: Confirm graceful handling of malformed payloads
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Coverage**:
  - Corrupted payload rejection
  - HTTP 400 error handling
  - Network error handling
  - Timeout error handling
  - Exception propagation validation

### 6. **Symbolic Layer Contribution Detection**
- **Goal**: Ensure injected events activate symbolic categories if applicable
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Coverage**:
  - Symbolic event injection: "Player swears vengeance after loss"
  - Symbolic tag detection (Retribution, Grief, Identity, Transformation)
  - Multi-category memory activation (emotional, semantic)
  - Symbolic layer response validation

## 🛠️ Mock/Fallback Mode

Each test runs in two modes:
- ✅ **Live Mode**: Requires localhost:5001 running (TNE API)
- ✅ **Mock Mode**: Simulates TNE responses using `unittest.mock.AsyncMock`

The test suite automatically detects TNE availability and falls back to mock mode when needed.

## 🧩 Supporting Utilities

The test suite imports and validates:
```python
from integrations.tne_event_mapper import map_action_to_event
from integrations.tne_bridge import send_event_to_tne, fetch_goal_alignment
```

## 🎯 Assertions Checklist

Each test confirms:
- ✅ Injection call returned 200 OK (or proper error handling)
- ✅ TNE response contains required goal categories
- ✅ All goal categories have numeric `alignment_score`
- ✅ Errors are caught and logged appropriately
- ✅ Symbolic layer outputs are included when applicable

## 📁 File Location

- `SoloHeart/tests/test_narrative_loop_mvp.py`

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Direct Execution
```bash
cd SoloHeart
python tests/test_narrative_loop_mvp.py
```

### With Pytest (Recommended)
```bash
cd SoloHeart
python -m pytest tests/test_narrative_loop_mvp.py -v
```

### Requirements
```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

## 📊 Test Results

```
============================================ 13 passed in 5.13s ============================================
```

All 13 tests pass, validating complete MVP integration readiness.

## 🧾 MVP Checklist Connections

This test suite validates the following items from `mvp_integration_checklist.md`:

- ✅ **Full-cycle event → memory injection → goal feedback loop**
- ✅ **Combat, dialogue, and exploration coverage**
- ✅ **Symbolic layer connection verified**
- ✅ **Journal logging active and validated**
- ✅ **Memory injection failure handling implemented**
- ✅ **Bridge methods tested in isolation and in flow**

## 🔮 Future Extensions (TODO)

The test suite includes TODO comments for future enhancements:

- **UI Goal Dashboard test hooks**: Integration with React components
- **Symbolic contradiction modeling**: Advanced symbolic analysis testing
- **Multi-character memory traces**: Multi-character scenario testing

## 🎉 MVP Launch Readiness

With all tests passing, the SoloHeart → TNE integration is ready for MVP launch. The test suite provides:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All critical integration pathways tested
2. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. **Mock Support**: Development and testing without TNE dependency
4. **Live Validation**: Real-time integration testing when TNE is available
5. **Documentation**: Clear test purposes and validation criteria

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding New Tests
1. Add test method to appropriate test class
2. Include both mock and live mode support
3. Add comprehensive assertions
4. Update this README with test details

### Test Maintenance
- Run tests before any integration changes
- Update mock responses when TNE API changes
- Validate new goal categories are tested
- Ensure error handling covers new scenarios
