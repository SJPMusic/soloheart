- **Prompt Integration**: `[StatTriggers]` and `[WorldState]` sections
- **Memory Persistence**: All updates saved to campaign data

### Enhanced Prompt Structure:
```
[System] - Core instructions and character context
[Context] - Campaign and session information
[Memory] - Recent memories and experiences
[Stats] - Character statistics and abilities
[StatTriggers] - Active stat-based narrative elements
[WorldState] - Current world state and conditions
[Symbolism] - Active symbolic elements and archetypes
[Goals] - Inferred narrative goals and motivations
[Input] - Player's current action
```

### Memory Loop Integration:
- **Stat Changes**: Recent stat modifications tracked in memory
- **World Events**: Location changes, item acquisitions, NPC interactions
- **Story Progression**: Flag updates and narrative milestones
- **Context Awareness**: All systems aware of current world state

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Stat-Based Branching:
```python
# Stat trigger extraction
triggers = self._extract_stat_triggers(character_stats)

# HP-based triggers
if current_hp <= 3:
    triggers.append("CRITICAL: You feel your vision blur...")
elif current_hp <= 5:
    triggers.append("DANGER: Your wounds are severe...")

# Ability score triggers
if ability_scores.get('intelligence', 10) >= 18:
    triggers.append("INTELLIGENCE: You recognize arcane symbols...")
```

### World State Management:
```python
# World state loading
world_state = self._load_world_state(campaign_id)

# World state updates
success = self._save_world_state(campaign_id, updated_state)

# API endpoints
@app.route('/api/world/state', methods=['GET'])
@app.route('/api/world/update', methods=['POST'])
```

### Frontend Integration:
```javascript
// World state refresh
async function refreshWorldState() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/world/state');
    const data = await response.json();
    updateWorldStateDisplay(data.world_state);
}

// World state updates
async function updateWorldState(updates) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/world/update', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({updates: updates})
    });
}
```
