## Subject Line Options:
- "The Narrative Engine: AI that remembers and evolves (not just responds)"
- "Beyond ChatGPT: AI with memory, context, and emotional intelligence"
- "SoloHeart demo + broader vision for narrative AI"

## Email Body:

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something I've been working on that I think you'd find interesting. I've developed **The Narrative Engine**—a fundamentally different approach to AI interaction that treats narrative as a simulation of human memory and reasoning, rather than just generating responses.

**What makes it different:**
- AI that actually remembers your choices and their emotional weight
- Stories that evolve based on layered memory systems, not just prompts
- Contextual reasoning that maintains coherence across time
- Domain-agnostic design that works beyond just entertainment

**Current proof-of-concept:** SoloHeart, a solo RPG where the AI remembers your character's journey, adapts to your decisions, and maintains narrative continuity across sessions. But the real potential is much broader—therapy, education, leadership development, strategic planning.

**Why I'm reaching out:** The technology is real, demonstrable, and ready for broader deployment. I'm looking for collaborators and investors who see the potential in AI that prioritizes memory, context, and emotional intelligence over simple response generation.

Would you be interested in seeing a demo? I can walk you through how it works and discuss potential applications in your domain.

Best,
Stephen

## Shorter DM Version:

Hi [Name]! I've built something I think you'd find fascinating—**The Narrative Engine**, an AI system that actually remembers and evolves rather than just responding. 

Current demo: SoloHeart (solo RPG), but designed for therapy, education, leadership, etc. The key innovation is treating narrative as memory simulation—AI that understands context and maintains continuity across time.

Tech is real and working. Looking for collaborators/investors interested in AI that prioritizes memory and emotional intelligence. Would love to show you a demo if you're curious!

What do you think?
