## About

I'm developing **The Narrative Engine**—a memory-driven, context-aware storytelling framework that treats narrative as a simulation of human memory and reasoning, rather than just linear story generation. While our current proof-of-concept is a solo RPG called "SoloHeart," the system is designed for much broader applications in therapy, education, leadership development, and strategic planning.

The core innovation is creating AI co-architects that understand context, remember choices with emotional weight, and evolve stories based on layered memory systems. Unlike traditional AI that generates responses in isolation, The Narrative Engine maintains coherent continuity across time, learning from interactions and adapting narratives based on decision history and emotional context.

I'm actively seeking collaborators and investors interested in exploring applications beyond gaming. The technology is real, demonstrable, and ready for deployment in domains where narrative continuity and contextual reasoning matter—from therapeutic AI companions that remember progress to educational systems that adapt to student engagement patterns. If you're interested in the future of AI interaction that prioritizes memory, context, and emotional intelligence, I'd love to connect.
