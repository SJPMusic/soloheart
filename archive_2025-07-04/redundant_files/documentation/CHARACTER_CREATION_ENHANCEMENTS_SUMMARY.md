# Vibe Code Character Creation Enhancements

## Overview

The Vibe Code character creation system has been enhanced with four major improvements to provide a better user experience, enable offline testing, and add robust fact tracking capabilities.

## 🎭 1. Mock LLM Fallback

### Purpose
Enable offline/local testing without requiring OpenAI API access.

### Implementation
- **Environment Variable**: `USE_MOCK_LLM=1` to enable mock responses
- **Location**: `dnd_game/simple_unified_interface.py`
- **Method**: `_mock_llm_response()` provides deterministic responses

### Usage
```bash
# Enable mock LLM for offline testing
export USE_MOCK_LLM=1
python consumer_launcher.py

# Disable mock LLM for production
export USE_MOCK_LLM=0
python consumer_launcher.py
```

### Mock Responses
The mock LLM provides canned responses for common character creation scenarios:
- **Race selection**: "Excellent choice! You are a Dragonborn Fighter. What would you like to name your character?"
- **Class selection**: "Perfect! You are a Fighter. What race would you like to be?"
- **Name input**: "Great name! Now, what background would you like for your character?"
- **Background selection**: "Perfect background choice! Character creation complete!"

## 🕒 2. Timestamp and Source Tagging

### Purpose
Track when and how character facts were established for auditability and debugging.

### Implementation
- **Timestamp**: ISO format UTC timestamp for each fact
- **Source**: Tracks origin ("player", "AI", "correction")
- **Location**: `_store_character_fact_in_memory()` method

### Memory Entry Format
```json
{
  "content": "Character fact confirmed: Thorin is a Dragonborn",
  "memory_type": "character_fact",
  "metadata": {
    "fact_type": "race",
    "value": "Dragonborn",
    "character_name": "Thorin",
    "confirmed_facts": ["race", "name"],
    "timestamp": "2025-07-01T19:06:08.727220",
    "source": "player"
  },
  "tags": ["character_creation", "character_fact", "race", "Thorin", "player"]
}
```

### Benefits
- **Audit Trail**: Track when each fact was established
- **Source Attribution**: Know whether player, AI, or correction established the fact
- **Debugging**: Identify when and how character data was modified
- **Memory Integration**: Enhanced vector memory with temporal context

## ↩️ 3. Undo Last Character Fact

### Purpose
Allow players to revert character creation decisions during the process.

### Implementation
- **Fact History**: Stack-based storage of previous values
- **Method**: `undo_last_fact()` restores previous state
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/character/vibe-code/undo`

### Usage
```python
# Programmatic usage
generator = SimpleCharacterGenerator()
generator._commit_fact("race", "Human", "player")
generator._commit_fact("race", "Elf", "player")
undone = generator.undo_last_fact()  # Returns ("race", "Human")

# API usage
POST /api/character/vibe-code/undo
{
  "campaign_id": "campaign_123"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Undid race: Human",
  "undone_fact": {
    "type": "race",
    "old_value": "Human"
  },
  "current_character_data": { ... }
}
```

### Features
- **Stack-based**: Can undo multiple facts in reverse order
- **Memory Integration**: Stores reversal events in vector memory
- **Safe Operation**: Returns `None` when no facts to undo
- **State Restoration**: Properly handles initial "Unknown" values

## 📝 4. Incremental Fact Commitment

### Purpose
Commit character facts immediately as they're confirmed, preventing repetition.

### Implementation
- **Detection**: `_detect_and_commit_facts()` analyzes conversation
- **Commitment**: `_commit_fact()` stores with timestamp and source
- **Memory**: `_store_character_fact_in_memory()` integrates with vector system

### Fact Types Supported
- **Race**: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Dragonborn, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Tiefling
- **Class**: All 12 D&D 5e classes
- **Name**: Extracted from natural language patterns
- **Background**: Acolyte, Criminal, Folk Hero, Noble, Sage, Soldier
- **Personality**: Extracted personality traits

### Detection Patterns
```python
# Race detection
if "you are a dragonborn" in combined_text:
    self._commit_fact("race", "Dragonborn", "player")

# Name detection
name_match = re.search(r"my name is ([a-z]+)", combined_text)
if name_match:
    self._commit_fact("name", name_match.group(1).title(), "player")
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Files

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python test_incremental_character_facts.py

# Run mock LLM test only
python test_mock_llm_simple.py

# Run demonstration
python demo_character_creation_enhancements.py
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Mock LLM fallback functionality
- ✅ Timestamp and source tagging
- ✅ Undo functionality with state restoration
- ✅ Incremental fact commitment
- ✅ Memory integration
- ✅ API endpoint functionality

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Offline Development
```bash
# Enable mock LLM for development
export USE_MOCK_LLM=1
python consumer_launcher.py

# Test character creation without API calls
# Navigate to http://localhost:5001
# Choose "Vibe Code Creation"
# All AI responses will be deterministic mock responses
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Ensure mock LLM is disabled
export USE_MOCK_LLM=0
python consumer_launcher.py

# Normal operation with OpenAI API

### API Integration
```javascript
// Undo last character fact
fetch('/api/character/vibe-code/undo', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ campaign_id: 'current_campaign' })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  if (data.success) {
    console.log(`Undid: ${data.undone_fact.type} = ${data.undone_fact.old_value}`);
  }
});
```
