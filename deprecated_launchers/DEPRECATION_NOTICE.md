# üö´ DEPRECATED LAUNCHERS

## Why These Files Were Moved

These launcher files have been deprecated to eliminate confusion and create a single, reliable entry point for SoloHeart.

## üéØ **Use This Instead**
```bash
python launch_soloheart.py
```

## üìÅ **Deprecated Files**

### **Root Level**
- `consumer_launcher.py` - Old consumer interface launcher

### **solo_heart/ Level**
- `launch_start_flow.py` - Old start screen launcher
- `launch_game.py` - Old game interface launcher  
- `launch_unified.py` - Old unified interface launcher
- `consumer_launcher.py` - Duplicate consumer launcher
- `simple_unified_interface.py` - Old simple interface
- `start_screen_interface.py` - Old start screen interface
- `narrative_focused_interface.py` - Old narrative interface
- `unified_narrative_interface.py` - Old unified narrative interface
- `unified_game_interface.py` - Old unified game interface
- `simple_unified_interface_backup.py` - Backup of old interface
- `simple_unified_interface_mock.py` - Mock interface for testing

## üîÑ **Migration Guide**

### **Before (Confusing)**
```bash
# Users had to guess which launcher to use:
python solo_heart/launch_start_flow.py
python solo_heart/launch_game.py
python solo_heart/launch_unified.py
python solo_heart/simple_unified_interface.py
python solo_heart/start_screen_interface.py
python solo_heart/narrative_focused_interface.py
python solo_heart/unified_narrative_interface.py
python solo_heart/unified_game_interface.py
python consumer_launcher.py
```

### **After (Clear)**
```bash
# Single, reliable launcher:
python launch_soloheart.py
```

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of Single Launcher**

1. **No Confusion** - Users know exactly which file to run
2. **Health Checks** - Comprehensive startup validation
3. **Error Recovery** - Automatic fixes for common issues
4. **Clear Messages** - Users understand what's happening
5. **Reliable Launch** - Works consistently across systems
6. **Port Management** - Automatic port conflict resolution
7. **Offline Mode** - Works without external dependencies

## üö® **If You Need These Files**

If you need to reference the old launchers for development:

1. **Check the git history** - All files are preserved in version control
2. **Look in this directory** - Files are moved here, not deleted
3. **Use the new launcher** - `launch_soloheart.py` has all the functionality

## üìä **Launcher Consolidation Summary**

### **Before Phase 2**
- **12 different launchers** across multiple directories
- **Confusing file names** - users didn't know which to use
- **Inconsistent behavior** - different launchers worked differently
- **Port conflicts** - multiple launchers tried to use same ports
- **No health checks** - launchers failed silently

### **After Phase 2**
- **1 single launcher** - `launch_soloheart.py`
- **Clear naming** - obvious what the file does
- **Consistent behavior** - same experience every time
- **Port management** - automatic conflict resolution
- **Comprehensive health checks** - tells users what's wrong

**The new `launch_soloheart.py` provides a better, more reliable experience than any of these deprecated launchers.**
