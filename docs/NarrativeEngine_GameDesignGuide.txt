# SoloHeart Game Design Guide

## Overview

SoloHeart is a narrative-driven D&D 5E solo roleplaying game that combines traditional tabletop mechanics with AI-powered storytelling. The game emphasizes character development, meaningful choices, and immersive narrative experiences.

## Core Design Principles

### Narrative-First Approach
- Story and character development take precedence over mechanics
- AI Dungeon Master adapts to player choices and character development
- Meaningful consequences drive narrative progression
- Character arcs and personal growth are central to gameplay

### Accessibility and Inclusivity
- Intuitive interface designed for players of all experience levels
- Clear, helpful guidance for new players
- Flexible character creation that accommodates diverse preferences
- Support for various play styles and preferences

### SRD 5.2 Compliance
- All game mechanics follow official D&D 5E rules
- Proper attribution to Wizards of the Coast
- No proprietary content included
- Creative Commons license compliance

## Character Creation System

### Natural Language Processing
- Players describe their character in natural language
- AI extracts character details and creates a complete character sheet
- Fallback pattern matching ensures reliability
- Real-time character sheet updates as player describes character

### Archetype Integration
- AI detects character archetypes from descriptions
- Archetype transformations tracked over time
- Symbolic analysis provides deeper character insights
- Character development patterns inform narrative direction

### SRD 5.2 Ability Scores
- Standard array, point buy, and roll 4d6 drop lowest methods
- Class-optimized ability score assignment
- Manual entry option for custom characters
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

## Game Mechanics

### Core D&D 5E Systems
- Combat mechanics with initiative and action economy
- Skill checks and saving throws
- Experience points and leveling
- Inspiration points and character motivation
- Inventory and equipment management

### AI-Powered Storytelling
- Dynamic narrative generation based on character actions
- Adaptive difficulty and challenge scaling
- Meaningful consequences for player choices
- Character-driven plot development
- World state persistence and continuity

### Memory and Continuity
- Session memory persists between play sessions
- Character development tracked over time
- World state changes remembered and referenced
- Narrative threads maintained across sessions
- Symbolic memory integration for deeper storytelling

## User Interface Design

### Character Creation Interface
- Clean, intuitive design for character creation
- Real-time feedback and validation
- Helpful guidance and suggestions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility features for all users

### Gameplay Interface

## Narrative Arc Viewer (Phase 4)

Players can now browse their active and resolved narrative arcs via a dedicated viewer. This tool exposes symbolic memory threads, contradiction markers, and allows filtering by character, arc phase, and symbolic role. It supports transparency for memory evolution and arc resolution.

### Arc Visualization
- Timeline view of character development
- Visual representation of archetype transformations
- Conflict resolution tracking
- Memory thread connections
- Symbolic pattern recognition

### Filtering and Search
- Filter arcs by type (character, world, plot)
- Filter by phase (active, resolved, abandoned)
- Filter by memory importance
- Search functionality for specific content
- Symbolic tag filtering

### Integration Features
- Real-time arc updates
- Memory persistence
- API endpoints for arc data
- Export functionality for arc analysis
- Cross-character arc relationships

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Systems
- Flask web framework for core functionality
- Gemma 3 AI integration for narrative generation
- SQLite database for data persistence
- RESTful API for frontend communication
- Session management and state persistence

### Frontend Systems
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for responsive design
- React components for modern UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Local storage for UI state persistence
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### AI Integration
- Modular LLM provider system
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability
- Context-aware prompt generation
- Memory integration for continuity
- Symbolic analysis for deeper insights

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive unit tests for all systems
- Integration tests for AI and database interactions
- UI tests for user interface functionality
