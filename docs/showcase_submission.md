# üåü SoloHeart Showcase Submission

## Project Name
**SoloHeart** ‚Äî Solo Roleplaying Powered by AI Memory and Meaning

## Description
SoloHeart is a solo DnD-style roleplaying engine built on top of The Narrative Engine (TNE). It enables longform storytelling with memory injection, symbolic goal inference, and persistent journaling ‚Äî powered entirely by an LLM-connected narrative core.

Unlike traditional AI storytelling tools that start fresh each session, SoloHeart maintains persistent memory of your character's journey, emotional context, and evolving goals. The system remembers what you've done, understands symbolic meaning in your choices, and adapts the narrative accordingly.
