# 📢 SoloHeart MVP Public Launch Announcement

We're excited to officially launch **SoloHeart**, a solo roleplaying experience powered by memory-aware AI.

Unlike traditional AI demos, SoloHeart remembers what you do, understands your goals, and evolves your story over time — powered by The Narrative Engine.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Memory Injection** with emotional context and symbolic understanding

## 🎮 What Makes SoloHeart Different

Traditional AI storytelling tools give you a new story each time. SoloHeart builds a **persistent narrative** that remembers your choices, understands your character's growth, and evolves the world based on your actions.

Powered by The Narrative Engine's memory system, SoloHeart maintains emotional context, tracks symbolic meaning, and provides goal suggestions that align with your character's journey.
