## Change Log

### 2025-07-05 15:45:00 - Campaign Recap Feature Implementation

**Context**: User requested a quality-of-life feature to automatically provide a recap of the current campaign state when loading a saved campaign, without requiring the player to prompt for it.

**Implementation**:
- **Added Campaign Recap Generation**: Created `generate_campaign_recap()` method in `SimpleNarrativeBridge` class
- **Smart Recap Logic**: Analyzes recent conversation history (last 6 messages) to generate contextual recap
- **New API Endpoint**: Added `/api/game/recap` endpoint to serve campaign recaps
- **Automatic Display**: Modified game screen to automatically request and display recap on page load
- **LLM-Powered Summaries**: Uses Ollama to generate natural, engaging recaps based on actual conversation history

**Key Features**:
1. **Intelligent Context Analysis**: Reviews recent conversation history to identify key events
2. **Character-Aware Recaps**: Includes character name, race, and class in recap context
3. **New Campaign Detection**: Provides appropriate welcome message for very new campaigns
4. **Automatic Integration**: Recap appears automatically when loading a saved campaign
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallback if recap generation fails

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def generate_campaign_recap(self, campaign_id: str) -> str:
    # Analyzes conversation history
    # Uses LLM to generate natural recap
    # Handles new vs. ongoing campaigns differently
    # Returns engaging, contextual summary
```

**Frontend Integration**:
```javascript
async function loadCampaignRecap() {
    // Requests recap from API
    // Displays as DM message
    // Handles errors gracefully
}
```

**Impact**:
- **Improved User Experience**: Players can immediately understand where they left off
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No need to remember or ask for context
- **Enhanced Immersion**: Natural, narrative-style recaps maintain story flow
- **Quality of Life**: Seamless campaign resumption

**References**:
- User request for automatic campaign recap
- SoloHeart conversation memory system
- Game screen template and JavaScript integration

### 2025-07-05 15:55:00 - Campaign Recap Session Fix

**Context**: Campaign recap feature was not working due to session persistence problems. The campaign_id was not being maintained between requests, causing the recap endpoint to return "No active campaign".

**Root Cause**: Flask session was not properly maintaining the campaign_id between the campaign loading request and the recap request.

**Solution**:
- **Modified Recap Endpoint**: Changed `/api/game/recap` to prioritize query parameter over session
- **Added Campaign Loading**: Recap endpoint now automatically loads campaign if not already loaded
- **Enhanced Frontend**: Modified `loadCampaignRecap()` to pass campaign_id as query parameter
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better logging and fallback mechanisms

**Technical Changes**:
- Recap endpoint now accepts `campaign_id` as query parameter
- Added automatic campaign loading in recap endpoint
- Enhanced debugging with detailed logging
- Modified frontend to extract campaign_id from URL parameters
- Updated campaign loading to include campaign_id in redirect URL

**Result**: Campaign recap now works reliably, providing contextual summaries based on actual conversation history.

### 2025-07-05 15:30:00 - Critical Fix: Narrative Engine Fabrication Issue

**Context**: User reported that the game was generating completely fabricated scenarios (e.g., "Baroness Elara", "Brindlemark", "party members") that didn't match the actual game state. This violated the domain-agnostic integrity principle by making up story content.

**Problem Analysis**:
- LLM was being given generic prompts encouraging it to "remember past events"
- System wasn't properly tracking actual conversation history
- Campaign data wasn't being properly saved/loaded
- Character data from character creation wasn't flowing correctly to campaign initialization

**Implementation**:
- **Fixed System Prompts**: Updated prompts to explicitly forbid making up content
- **Added Conversation History Persistence**: Campaign saves now include actual conversation history
- **Enhanced Campaign Loading**: Restored conversation history when loading campaigns
- **Improved New Campaign Detection**: System now detects new campaigns and provides appropriate prompts
- **Added Explicit Constraints**: Prompts now include "NEVER make up story content, NPCs, or events"

**Key Changes**:
1. `process_player_input()`: Added new campaign detection and honest prompts
2. `save_campaign()`: Now saves conversation history to campaign file
3. `load_campaign()`: Now restores conversation history from campaign file
4. System prompts: Added explicit constraints against fabrication

**Impact**:
- Eliminates fabricated story content
- Maintains narrative integrity based on actual player interactions
- Preserves conversation history across sessions
- Ensures honest communication about what the system knows vs. doesn't know

**References**:
- Narrative Engine domain-agnostic integrity rule
- User report of fabricated content issue
- SoloHeart conversation memory system

### 2025-07-05 02:00:00 - Inspiration Points and Saving Throws Implementation

**Context**: User requested support for inspiration points and saving throws in the SoloHeart integration layer while maintaining domain-agnostic integrity of the Narrative Engine.

**Implementation**:
- Added `inspiration_points` and `saving_throws` to domain-specific fields list in integration layer
- Created four helper methods in `narrative_engine_integration.py`:
  - `set_inspiration_points(character_name, points)`: Set inspiration points for a character
  - `get_inspiration_points(character_name)`: Retrieve inspiration points
  - `set_saving_throws(character_name, saving_throws_dict)`: Set saving throw modifiers
  - `get_saving_throws(character_name)`: Retrieve saving throw modifiers
- All game-specific data stored in `current_state` dictionary
- No impact on Narrative Engine core structure

**Key Features**:
- **Domain Encapsulation**: All game-specific features stored in `current_state`
- **Clean Integration**: Helper methods in integration layer only
- **No Core Impact**: Narrative Engine core remains domain-agnostic
- **Easy Usage**: Simple API for setting/getting inspiration and saving throws

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Set inspiration points
integration.set_inspiration_points("Thorin", 2)

# Get inspiration points
points = integration.get_inspiration_points("Thorin")

# Set saving throws
saving_throws = {"dexterity": 2, "wisdom": 1}
integration.set_saving_throws("Thorin", saving_throws)

# Get saving throws
throws = integration.get_saving_throws("Thorin")
```

**Impact**:
- Enhanced SoloHeart with D&D 5E game mechanics
- Maintained domain-agnostic integrity of Narrative Engine
- Provided clean API for game-specific features
- Demonstrated proper integration layer design

### 2025-07-05 01:00:00 - Narrative Engine Domain-Agnostic Integrity Audit and Fixes

**Context**: Applied the narrative_engine_domain_agnostic_integrity rule across the entire codebase to ensure the Narrative Engine remains domain-agnostic and reusable across different applications.

**Critical Violations Found and Fixed**:

1. **Domain-Specific Terminology in Core Engine** ❌ FIXED
   - **Location**: `narrative_core/narrative_engine.py` lines 577-620
   - **Violation**: The `add_character` method was making decisions about data filtering and contained domain-specific logic
   - **Fix**: Removed all filtering logic from core engine. Core engine now accepts any data structure as provided by integration layer

2. **Integration Layer Passing Domain-Specific Data** ❌ FIXED
   - **Location**: `solo_heart/narrative_engine_integration.py` lines 50-100
   - **Violation**: Game-specific fields like `race`, `class`, `alignment` were being passed as top-level fields
   - **Fix**: Implemented strict domain-specific field filtering. All game-specific fields now go into `current_state` only

3. **Memory Layer Separation Issues** ⚠️ IDENTIFIED
   - **Location**: `narrative_core/narrative_engine.py` lines 38-43
   - **Status**: Memory layers are defined but not consistently enforced in practice
   - **Action**: Requires future implementation of proper memory layer separation

4. **Engine Making Autonomous Decisions** ❌ FIXED
   - **Location**: `narrative_core/narrative_engine.py` lines 577-620
   - **Violation**: Engine was deciding how to filter and process data
   - **Fix**: Moved all filtering logic to integration layer. Core engine now purely stores data as provided

**Implementation**:
- Modified `add_character` method to accept any data structure without filtering
- Updated integration layer to properly separate universal vs domain-specific fields
- Fixed variable scope issues in `simple_unified_interface.py`
- Tested character creation successfully

**Impact**: 
- Narrative Engine core is now truly domain-agnostic
- All game-specific data is properly encapsulated in `current_state`
- System maintains functionality while preserving architectural integrity
- Character creation now works without domain-specific errors

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Character creation API working correctly
- ✅ Domain-specific fields properly encapsulated
- ✅ No more `KeyError: 'id'` or domain-specific field errors
- ✅ Narrative Engine maintains memory and context functionality

### 2025-07-05 00:25:00 - Character Creation Error Resolution

**Context**: Character creation was failing with `Character.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'level'` error. The issue was that D&D-specific fields were being passed as top-level arguments to the Character dataclass.

**Implementation**:
- Updated `narrative_engine_integration.py` to filter character data properly
- Modified `narrative_core/narrative_engine.py` to handle field filtering
- Ensured only Character dataclass fields are passed at top level
- All D&D-specific fields (level, hit_points, etc.) are now encapsulated in `current_state`

**Impact**:
- Fixed character creation errors
- Maintained clean separation between universal metadata and game-specific state
- Future-proofed for other RPG systems

**References**:
- Character dataclass definition in narrative_engine.py
- Integration layer in narrative_engine_integration.py

### 2025-07-05 00:20:00 - Campaign Context Variable Scope Fix

**Context**: `campaign_context` variable was not defined in all code paths, causing NameError during character creation.

**Implementation**:
- Added `campaign_context = None` initialization at start of `start_character_creation` method
- Ensured variable is always defined before use
- Added proper error handling for context retrieval

**Impact**:
- Resolved NameError in character creation
