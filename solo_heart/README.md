# SoloHeart Game Engine (SRD 5.2-Compliant)

## Project Summary
This is an enhanced demo for the Narrative Engine: an immersive, LLM-powered solo DnD 5E experience with advanced character creation and symbolic meaning integration. The system enables a single player to create a character using natural language and play through a campaign with an AI Dungeon Master, all in a clean, SRD 5.2-compliant, and legally safe environment.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Character Creation
- **LLM-Powered Extraction**: Uses Ollama's llama3 model for semantic understanding of character descriptions
- **Immediate Fact Commitment**: Extract and commit character facts immediately from natural language input
- **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time updates as player describes character with visual feedback
- **No Linear Questioning**: Describe your character naturally without being prompted for specific details
- **Robust Fallback System**: Pattern matching when LLM extraction fails for reliability
- **Multi-Fact Extraction**: Extracts name, race, class, background, age, gender, alignment, personality, motivations, trauma, gear, combat style simultaneously
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only commits high-confidence facts with configurable thresholds
- **Context Awareness**: Uses surrounding text to infer missing information
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Only requests confirmation when facts are truly ambiguous
- **DnD 5E Compliance**: Automatically tracks missing required fields and validates character data

### ðŸ§  Symbolic Meaning Framework
- **Archetypal Tagging**: Facts tagged with Jungian archetypes (Father, Shadow, Journey, etc.)
- **Chaos/Order Tension**: Dynamic tracking of narrative stability and character development
- **Narrative Decay Detection**: Identifies contradictions and avoidance patterns
- **Symbolic Coherence**: Ensures meaningful character development and story progression
- **Psychological Depth**: Inspired by Jordan B. Peterson's *Maps of Meaning* principles

### ðŸ’¬ Natural Language Interface
- **Freeform Character Creation**: Describe your character concept in detail without constraints
- **AI-Driven Conversation**: LLM guides character development through natural dialogue
- **Real-Time Validation**: Character data validated against SRD 5.2 schema
- **Structured Output**: Character data saved in standardized JSON format with symbolic metadata
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and edge cases

### ðŸ“‹ SRD 5.2 Compliant Character System
- **Complete Character Schema**: All standard DnD 5E character fields included
- **Legal Compliance**: Uses only open-source SRD content

### ðŸ’¾ Persistent Campaign System
- **Automatic Saving**: All game state automatically persisted
- **Campaign State Management**: Tracks story progress, character development, and world state
- **Session Continuity**: Seamless experience across multiple play sessions
- **Symbolic Persistence**: Chaos/order tension and archetypal state maintained across sessions

- **Thematic Styling**: Immersive, fantasy-themed interface design
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic UI updates without page refreshes
- **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time character sheet updates as you type
- **Accessibility**: Clean, readable design with good contrast and navigation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PianomanSJPM/solo-rp-game-demo.git
   cd solo-rp-game-demo/solo_heart
   ```
2. Install dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended):
