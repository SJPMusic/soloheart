# 🚀 SoloHeart MVP Launch: Solo Roleplay Powered by The Narrative Engine

We're proud to announce the MVP release of SoloHeart — a solo DnD-style roleplaying engine powered by memory-aware AI, symbolic goal modeling, and a fully modular architecture.

## 🎯 What's Inside

### ✅ Core Features
- **Full memory injection → goal inference → journaling cycle**
- **Symbolic goal detection** using The Narrative Engine (TNE)
- **Fallback logic** when AI is offline
- **Mock/live testing modes** for all major systems
- **Frontend dashboard** with live narrative sync
- **CI-compatible test suite** and Render deployment config

### 🧠 Technical Architecture
- **Memory Injection**: Real-time event streaming to TNE
- **Goal Inference**: AI-powered narrative goal suggestions
- **Session Journaling**: Automated campaign documentation
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation when TNE unavailable
- **Bridge Integration**: Complete SoloHeart → TNE event mapping

### 📂 Repository Highlights
- `tests/full_mvp_integration_test.py`: Automated validation suite
- `scripts/finalize_mvp_release.py`: End-to-end release preparation
- `README.md`: Comprehensive pitch, usage, and architecture overview
- `docs/release_checklist_mvp.md`: Complete release validation checklist
- `tests/coverage_mvp_report.md`: Comprehensive test coverage summary

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SoloHeart

# Run the integration test suite
python tests/full_mvp_integration_test.py --mode mock

# Start the frontend dashboard
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

### Live Mode Testing
```bash
# Start TNE backend (in separate terminal)
cd ../TNE && uvicorn api.narrative_api:app --reload --port 5001

# Run tests with live TNE integration
python tests/full_mvp_integration_test.py --mode live
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

All critical integration areas have automated test coverage:

- ✅ **System Readiness**: Module imports, environment setup, data validation
- ✅ **Memory Injection**: Event streaming, TNE API integration, error handling
- ✅ **Goal Inference**: AI-powered suggestions, pattern analysis, confidence scoring
- ✅ **Session Journal Export**: JSON and Markdown formats, campaign persistence
- ✅ **Bridge Integration**: Complete SoloHeart → TNE event mapping cycle
- ✅ **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful degradation when TNE unavailable
- ✅ **Goal Dashboard Sync**: Real-time UI updates, polling, data formatting
- ✅ **Compliance Validation**: Code standards, restricted term filtering

## 🎮 Use Cases

### For Writers
- Generate narrative goals based on character actions
- Maintain consistent story arcs across sessions
