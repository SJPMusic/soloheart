## Project Summary

This is a proof-of-concept demo for the **Narrative Engine**: an immersive, LLM-powered solo DnD 5E experience. The system enables a single player to create a character using natural language and play through a campaign with an AI Dungeon Master, all in a clean, SRD 5.1-compliant, and legally safe environment.

## How It Works

```
Player Input â†’ LLM Processing â†’ Narrative Response â†’ Campaign State Update
     â†“              â†“                â†“                    â†“
Natural Language â†’ Context Analysis â†’ Story Generation â†’ Persistent Save
     â†“              â†“                â†“                    â†“
Character Creation â†’ Memory Systems â†’ Emotional Tracking â†’ Campaign Progression
```

### Core Flow
1. **Start Screen** â†’ Choose to begin new campaign or continue existing
2. **Vibe Code Creation** â†’ Natural conversation with AI to build your character
3. **Narrative Gameplay** â†’ Immersive storytelling with persistent campaign state
4. **Save & Continue** â†’ Seamless persistence across sessions

## Key Features

- **ðŸŽ¯ Start Screen**: Begin a new campaign, continue, or delete existing campaigns
- **ðŸ’¬ Vibe Code Character Creation**: Create a character through natural conversation with the LLM (GPT-4o-mini or compatible)
- **ðŸ“‹ SRD-Compliant Character Data**: All character data is saved in a structured, open format
- **ðŸ“– Immersive Narrative Gameplay**: Seamless transition into a pure narrative interface, with the LLM acting as DM
- **ðŸ’¾ Persistent Campaigns**: Save, load, and delete campaigns with persistent storage
- **ðŸ“± Mobile-Responsive UI**: Clean, thematic, and immersive design

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PianomanSJPM/solo-rp-game-demo.git
   cd solo-rp-game-demo/solo_heart
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Add your OpenAI API key to .env
   ```

### Running the Demo
1. **Start the start screen interface** (port 5001):
   ```bash
   python start_screen_interface.py
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, start the narrative interface** (port 5002):
   ```bash
   python narrative_focused_interface.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser**:
   - Start screen: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
   - Narrative gameplay: [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002)

## Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Start a New Campaign
- Click "Start New Campaign" and follow the prompts
- Choose your preferred character creation method

### 2. Vibe Code Character Creation
- Select the natural language option
- Converse with the AI to describe your character concept
- The LLM will ask clarifying questions and build your character sheet

### 3. Immersive Gameplay
- After character creation, transition directly into narrative gameplay
- Respond naturally to the AI DM's storytelling
- Your choices and character development are tracked and remembered

### 4. Campaign Management
- Return to the start screen to continue or delete campaigns
- All progress is automatically saved and persistent

## ðŸš€ MVP Pitch: Why This Integration Matters

SoloHeart now integrates fully with The Narrative Engine (TNE), enabling longform storytelling with memory injection, symbolic goal inference, session journaling, and graceful fallback logic.

All 8 MVP criteria have been met and validated with automated tests.

This confirms readiness for public deployment, collaborator onboarding, and external stakeholder review.

**Key wins:**
- âœ… Modular, testable architecture
- âœ… Memory + goal alignment loop complete
- âœ… Full support for mock and live TNE modes
- âœ… Ready for CI/CD and Render deployment

**Technical Achievements:**
- **Memory Injection**: Real-time event streaming to TNE
- **Goal Inference**: AI-powered narrative goal suggestions
- **Session Journaling**: Automated campaign documentation
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation when TNE unavailable
- **Dashboard Sync**: Live goal alignment visualization
- **Compliance**: Production-ready code standards

**Integration Status:** Production-ready as of 2025-07-17
